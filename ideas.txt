# TODO:
# look at reward function
#  evluate the model on a test set of images
# do 20/80 # train/test split
# look for similat results 
# play with steps 
# if needed: add all the YOLO training data, just hold out test set for CNN performance evaluation
# ablate brightness and contrast, see if one is more important than the other
# then explore gamma correction, histogram equalization, CLAHE, etc. 
# try CNN based input for RL 

# save the best model 
# try again for confidence increasing reward for larger data set 
# metric idea - %mulitple detections out of total images / steps 
# should identify any images that never get detected, and then we can look at those images to see if they are problematic
# need to scrub bad images from the dataset, or add more data augmentation to make them more robust
# TODO: add IoU check for pupil in eye.Becomes more relevant with evaluation, but should be incorporated into reward function
